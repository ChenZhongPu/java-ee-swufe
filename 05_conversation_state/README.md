The HTTP protocol uses **stateless** connections. The client browser makes a connection to the server, sends the request, gets the response, and closes the connection. In other words, the connection exists for only a *single* request/response.

An `HttpSession` object can hold conversational state across multiple requests from the same client. In other words, it persists for an entire `session` with a specific client. We can use it to store everything we got back from the client in all the requests the client makes during a session.
