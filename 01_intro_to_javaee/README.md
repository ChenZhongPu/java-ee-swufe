# HTML
[W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) is a good site to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# HTTP
Most of the conversations held on the web between clients and servers are held using the HTTP protocol, which allows for simple request and response conversations. The client sends an HTTP request, and the server answers with an HTTP response.

For more technique details, you may refer to [HTTP: The Definitive Guide](https://book.douban.com/subject/1440226/).

# Optional exercise of this week
Re-implement a tiny HTTP server using `Java NIO`, and then use [Apache JMeter][https://jmeter.apache.org/] to test the performance of this tiny HTTP server.
